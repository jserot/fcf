How to define and compute on values with algebraic data types.
Here illustrated with a FSM returning the result of `map (fun x->x+1)` to a list.
Note. because of the _terminal recursive_ formulation of `inc_list`, the result list is
reversed wrt. to the input list. See `../list_map2` for a non-reversed version.
